        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>StatBot is a discord bot built with the primary purpose of tracking player statistics for amateur LoL
            tournaments. The bot gives tournament admins a way to create a tournament, seperated by optional divisions,
            and create tournament codes. The codes can then be distributed to each team. The match data is compiled and
            saved. Tournament participants can use discord commands to see the overall leaderboards for each statistic,
            the leaderboard for each lane, and a player's individual statistics. This bot will be a helpful and fun tool
            for many of the leagues I personally participate in.</p>
